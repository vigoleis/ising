This repo performs monte carlo simulation for the Ising model (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ising_model).
The algorithm etc are mostly based on a lecture I attended a few years ago.
The material can also be found in:

BÃ¶ttcher, Lucas, and Hans J. Herrmann. Computational Statistical Physics. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2021.

## NB:
 * I did my best with providing tests but I cannot give any guarantees on the correctnes of the calculations.
 * I am doing this for fun. I am not an expert in Rust or statistical physics so it might be that some of the code is not ideal.
